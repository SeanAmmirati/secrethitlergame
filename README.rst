This is the start of a personal project of setting up the internal state of a secret hitler game. 


Description
===========

Due to my interest in the game `Secret Hitler <secrethitler.com>`_, the intention of this program is to: 

* Keep track of the state of the game, that which is public knowledge to all players

* (Eventually) Assess the probabilities of particular players being fascist/liberal

* (Eventually) Create an A.I. which can play the limited information game (a difficult task)


This is mainly just a personal project that I will be developing in my spare time. Feel free to make any suggestions 
or improvements!

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.1. For details and usage
